# Notes of Python

### 1. main function - Best practice in Python
* Put most code into a function or class.
* Use __name__ to control execution of your code.
* Create a function called main() to contain the code you want to run.
* Call other functions from main().
```python
def main():
  println("Hello, World!")
  
if __name__=="__main__":
  main()

```
