# Notes

### 1. RESTful API: 
* API stands for Application Programming Interface and it basically allows a piece of software to talk to another.
* REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. This essentially refers to a style of web architecture that has many underlying characteristics and governs the behavior of clients and servers. 
* REST is defined by 6 constraints: client-server, stateless, cacheable, layered system, uniform interface, code on demand:

 *_Client–server_: Client application and server application MUST be able to evolve separately without any dependency on each other. A client should know only resource URIs while server should know only database and data on the server.
