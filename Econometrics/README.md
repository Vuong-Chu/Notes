#### 1. Probability vs Likelihood

__Probability__: As a function of x, treating θ as known/observed. If I have a fair coin (parameter value) then the probability that it will come up heads is 0.5.

__Likelihood__: As a function of θ, treating x as observed. If I flip a coin 100 times and it comes up heads 52 times then it has a high likelihood of being fair (the numeric value of likelihood potentially taking a number of forms).
